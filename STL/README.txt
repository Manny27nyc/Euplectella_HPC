The STL files of all geometries are provided. They can be directly imported in commercial and "in-house" CFD/FEM softwares.
PLease, follow these instructions:

1) The cylinder geometry (P1) is not shared: it can be re-created with any software/method;
2) P2 geometry can be re-created by using a cylinder (as per point 1)) and the file Ridges.STL.zip
3) S1 geometry is provided with file P1-base_element.stl.zip
4) S2 gemetry is cretaed merging P1-base_element.stl.zip  and  Ridges.STL.zip

5) E. aspergillum complete model is provided in file Euplectella_Aspergillum.rar
