Here you'll find 5 input file

bgk.A.input	--> infinite cylinder
bgk.B.input	--> infinite cylinder with ridges
bgk.C.input	--> infinite network structure
bgk.D.input	--> infinite network structure with ridges
bgk.S.input	--> full sponge simulation

For every geometry 5 differente Re numbers was simulated, varing, as you can see in the input files only

* svisc (i.e viscosity)
* itfin (i.e end of simulation)
* itrestart (i.e starting from scratch/restoring)

The Re=500 sumulation use the Re=100 dump as initial condition, 
The Re=1000 sumulation use the Re=500 dump as initial condition, 
The Re=1500 sumulation use the Re=1000 dump as initial condition, 
The Re=2000 sumulation use the Re=1500 dump as initial condition, 

We use 1'000'000 timestep to "thermalize" the simulation, data are collected 
via a further run of 200'000 with all statistics
